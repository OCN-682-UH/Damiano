# Dog Tax

For motivation and to honor the dog tax, here is a picture of my dog, Harper, and my honorary dog (my cat who thinks he's a dog), Mango. 

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
  knitr::include_graphics(c('../Data/Harper.JPG', '../Data/Mango.JPG'))

# Load Libraries

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)     # data from tidytuesday
library(here)             # file paths
library(tidyverse)
library(magick)           # image processing

# Load Data

I chose a data set from a past tidytuesday : [Dog Breeds](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/readme.md)
```{r}
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-02-01')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2022, week = 5)

breed_traits <- tuesdata$breed_traits

# Or read in the data manually

breed_traits <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/breed_traits.csv')

# Bad Plot
### Modify and Wrangle Data 
Goals:

- To identify the top _15_ dog breeds of 2020

- To show the breed traits of the top _15_ dog breeds of 2020

- To join my two data sets together (breed rank and breed trait)

```{r}
### Modify Data
#Pull dataframes from my repository

breed_traits <- read.csv(here("BadPlot_GoodPlot","Data", "breed_traits.csv"))

# I want only the 2020 data
breed_rank_all <- read.csv(here("BadPlot_GoodPlot","Data", "breed_rank.csv")) %>%
  select(Breed, `X2020Rank`)

###Data Wrangling 
#Join the two datasets together by Breed
#Pivot longer by attributes and values so the data set is easier to view
#Select only breed, 2020 rank, attributes and values to be in the df

breed_data_15 <- left_join(breed_rank_all,breed_traits, by="Breed") %>%
  filter(`X2020Rank` <= 15) %>%        #top 15 dog breeds
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Affectionate.With.Family: Drooling.Level),
               names_to = "Attributes",
               values_to = "Values") %>%
  select(c(Breed, X2020Rank, Attributes, Values))

# Plot the Bad
*cries in R*

Why is it bad?

- **Overload of information & provides no context**: You have no idea what the graph is telling you. You would never know the graph is about the AKC's 2020 top 15 breeds and their personality traits. That's a problem! Your graph should easily inform your reader of the data.

- **Unclear!**: This graph has way too many points, variables, data, and types of geoms. The legend is overwhelming and does not help understand the graph. Also, the aesthetics are over-mapped. Also, the graph was angled, so it makes it even harder to understand (if that was even possible!). 

- **Irresponsible!**: The axes titles do not help the reader. The x axis labels are illegible inside the graph (aka vortex). 

- **Overuse of color**: This can be distracting and confusing.

- **Overlapping bars and points**: The bars and points overlap (yes there is bars! They are hiding), so you cannot see the data. 

- **Too much text inside graph**: There is way to much text inside the plot! The text overlaps to the point that you cannot read it. I should not include text in a graph that you cannot read. 

- **Wrong use of images**: The dog in the bottom right of the graph serves zero purpose (besides joy) to the graph. Images in a graph should only be used to supplement the graph in a positive way.

- **Legend**: The legend serves no purpose to the graph. Also, the title should be "Breeds".

- **Spelling and Grammar**: The graph is riddled with  incorrect spelling and grammar errors.

- **She does not look awesome**: It is cluttered and the colors are scary.

# Good Plot
### Modify and Wrangle Data 

Goals:

- To identify the top _5_ dog breeds of 2020

- To show the breed traits of the top _5_ dog breeds of 2020

- To join my two data sets together (breed rank and breed trait)


```{r}
### Modify Data
#Pull dataframes from my repository

breed_traits <- read.csv(here("BadPlot_GoodPlot","Data", "breed_traits.csv"))

# I want only the 2020 data
breed_rank_all <- read.csv(here("BadPlot_GoodPlot","Data", "breed_rank.csv")) %>%
  select(Breed, `X2020Rank`)

###Data Wrangling 
#Join the two datasets together by Breed
#Pivot longer by attributes and values so the data set is easier to view
#Select only breed, 2020 rank, attributes and values to be in the df

breed_data_5 <- left_join(breed_rank_all,breed_traits, by="Breed") %>%
  filter(`X2020Rank` <= 5) %>%     #top 5 dog breeds
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Affectionate.With.Family: Drooling.Level),
               names_to = "Attributes",
               values_to = "Values") %>%
  select(c(Breed, X2020Rank, Attributes, Values))
  
  #mutate(Attributes = fct_recode(Attributes, "Good with Children" = "Good.With.Young.Children",
                            #     "Good with Dogs" = "Good.With.Other.Dogs",
                            #     "Shedding Level" = "Shedding.Level",
                            #     "Grooming Frequency" = "Coat.Grooming.Frequency",
                            #     "Drooling Level" = "Drooling.Level"))
    #useful to learn how to change facet labels if labeller function does not work
               
```

# Plot the Good

Why is it good?

- The plot's y axis goes in descending order from #1 dog breed to #5 dog breed. This helps the reader visualize the data chronologically. 
- The title, subtitle, axes titles, and caption are informative for the reader. 

- I believe it helps the reader understand the qualities of the AKC 2020 top 5 breed. 

- The data was cleaned in a way that helped the graph succeed. 

- Clear, concise, to the point.

- Appropriate and appealing color palette. 

- 2D!

- The bars start at 0.

- The graph shows the data.
